# Usefull Unity3d C# Scripts
My Collection of modular useable C# Scripts for Unity3d Games

These are my favourite Scripts, which i use to create my games.
I designed them to be as "modular" as possible in order to use them in different games too.
Use them for your own projects, but if there is a copyright mark(e.g. copyright: creator Marvin Plum github.com/lnxtt) in the top of the script and you want to publish the game please respect my work and cleary tell the user, that you have seen it here and link to it.

If you have own ideas for these scripts, found an error or want someone to collaborate on your scripts feel free to tell me.
